# PlasterTalk evaluation
The evaluations will be made from the user's point of view and from a technical point of view.

## User:
User evaluation has been made after a call [Raffaela Bucolo](http://www.antichita.uniroma1.it/en/content/bucolo-raffaella), [Claudia Carlucci](https://web.uniroma1.it/polomuseale/node/5582) and [Mariateresa Curcio](https://web.uniroma1.it/polomuseale/node/5583) from [Museo dell'Arte Classica - Sapienza](https://web.uniroma1.it/polomuseale/museo-arte-classica). We give them a view about the first version of the project, and they give us the following insights about how artwork managment works within a museum:
* artowrks does not change position very often within a museum, so they were not interested to track movements inside the rooms
* however, movements of statues are very often to other museum, for temporary exhibions. They mentioned a temporary exhibition at Venice were some plasters from Museo Classica - La Sapienza were required and they need to be careful to avoid thermal shock for plasters during the transportation,
* they mentioned he need for museum archivists to compile the *conditional report*, a kind of document to describe the status of an artwork after each movement. The measures taken from a statue may be useful to address the features of a statue, also they need to retrieve them in a *csv format*, since their work is mainly done through Excel files. 

## Software:
The main part of our application will be developed on *Riot-OS*, which is a small operating system for networked systems. This firmware will be run on Hardware boards made available by [Iot-Lab](https://www.iot-lab.info/hardware/m3/), which allows you to test the firmware with real sensors (Oscilloscope, Gyroscope, etc.). To test statue movements, we will emulate them through a *Python script*, also we can develop a mobile application where the telephone sensrs may simulate the statue behaviour when moved.
All data generated by the hardware will be sent to the AWS Cloud platform. Various platform within AWS will be used, so it will be crucial to address the final pricing for each resources that will be used.

Very important parameter will be the measurement of message latency, being information related to security, timeliness is very important. By adding a time stamp to each message and implementing a check on each message we will be able to calculate latency. Based on these checks, we will know if the system we have implemented is efficient.
