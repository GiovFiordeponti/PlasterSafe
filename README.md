## Description

As part the [Internet of Things course of MSc in Computer Science Engineering at La Sapienza](http://ichatz.me/Site/InternetOfThings2020), *Plaster Talk* is a project, designed for [Museo dell'Arte Classica - Sapienza](https://web.uniroma1.it/polomuseale/museo-arte-classica), that aims to make artworks a living part of the museum, providing to the visitors useful information, thanks to the support of the museum staff. If you want to learn more about this project, you can find more information about it at the following sections:

- [Architecture](https://github.com/FlowerOfTheBridges/PlasterTalk/tree/master/Architecture): here you can find the main technologies and implementation techniques used in order to make a working prototype
- [Evaluation](https://github.com/FlowerOfTheBridges/PlasterTalk/tree/master/Evaluation): here you can find some insights on how both design and architectural process have been evaluated.
